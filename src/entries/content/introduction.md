title: About Me

I like websites. Most of my time is spent making them. I’ve been doing it professionally for a little over 5 years now. I started off building statically generated sites with tools like Hugo and Jekyll. Now, I mostly work with Angular and React. But my focus remains the same; I strive to build accessible and performant websites that create an enjoyable experience for anyone. And more recently, I’ve begun to build robust back-end systems with Node.
