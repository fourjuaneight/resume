I aim to create accessible and engaging experiences for everyone through the web. Over the last 5+ years, I've helped a wide range of companies bring their vision to life through modern and innovative web technologies and matured stacks we rely on every day. With a focus on writing maintainable code to collaborate efficiently with others, my hope is to share my love for the web with a passionate team.
