Like everyone, this varies. But most recently (last year or so) I've been invested in cataloging as much of the stuff I find interesting online as possible. This started with a bookmarking app, then a Google Sheets doc, transitioned into Airtable, and now it's all on a [Postgres + GraphQL server](https://hasura.io/).

This has become such a fun project that I've built various mobile scripts with a combination of [iOS Shortcuts](https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts/welcome/ios) and [Scriptable](https://scriptable.app/) scripts for saving items. And to further archive and backup data, I've made various [scripts that run regularly via GitHub Actions](https://github.com/fourjuaneight/archiver). As well as a [serverless endpoint on Cloudflare Workers](https://github.com/fourjuaneight/bookmarker).
