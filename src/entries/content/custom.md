Like everyone, this varies. But most recently (last year or so) I've been invested in cataloging as much of the stuff I find interesting online as possible. This started with a bookmarking app, then a Google Sheets doc, transitioned into Airtable, and now it's all on a Postgres + GraphQL server.

This has become such a fun project that I've built various mobile scripts with a combination of iOS Shortcuts and Scriptable scripts for saving items. And to further archive and backup data, I've made various scripts that run regularly via GitHub Actions. As well as a serverless endpoint on Cloudflare Workers.
