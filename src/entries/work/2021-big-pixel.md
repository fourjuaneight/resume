Taking on a senior role gave me the privilege of serving as a resource for many of my peers. During this time, I've focused on ensuring we have solid documentation both in our code and throughout the various channels of communication we utilize.

Since most of our clientele are corporations in need of internal apps, my job shifted towards web apps, as opposed to web site. But my goals remained the same; reliability and accessibility.

Here are some of our recent projects:

## [Toggle Books](https://builder.togglebookfactory.com)

  - React
  - Gatsby
  - Redux
  - Tailwind
  - TypeScript

Ah, Qwerky. That's the name of the little robot you interact with on this book builder site. This was one of the most challenging projects I've ever worked on. Audio playback, dynamic word bubble captions, character transitions, and loads of selection-based combinations. But we managed to ship an incredible product.

The entirety of the site is statically built, all assets are lazy-loaded, and the app works completely offline. Everything runs off of 3 JSON data files that easily allow for new books to be added. It's a complex dance coordinated by the audio playback. Start and stop determine what and when something transitions on the app.

## [Oransi](https://www.mapmyair.com)

  - Angular (SSR)
  - Nest
  - Apollo
  - Graphql
  - TypeScript

This was my first foray into back-end development. NestJS is used as the API, with a GraphQL layer for I/O. This connects to various data sources, as well as a Postgres database for account management. Which is authenticated via JWTs. All of those are new technologies I've learned how to work with within the last few months. And it's been an incredible learning experience.

But hasn't been without its problems. We are currently fighting a memory leak on the front-end, which has been an amazing educational journey on its own, but quite the challenge nonetheless.
