Taking on a senior role gave me the privilege of serving as a resource for many of my peers. During this time, I've focused on ensuring we have solid documentation both in our code and throughout the various channels of communication we utilize.

Since most of our clientele are corporations in need of internal apps, my job shifted towards web apps, as opposed to a website. But my goals remained the same, reliability and accessibility being at the forefront.

Here are some of our recent projects:

## [Toggle Book Factory](https://builder.togglebookfactory.com)

- React
- Gatsby
- Redux
- Tailwind
- TypeScript

The client approached us with an idea for a kid's book builder. This would require a lot of user experience considerations and a well-thought-out infrastructure. The result was a wonderful orchestration of various web and 3rd party APIs. Through many iterations, we were able to ship a beautiful product that is accessible to a young audience and manageable for the client without the need for developer intervention. All product info and assets are handled through Shopify. And book configurations are stored on a serverless Hasura database and API.

## [Oransi](https://www.mapmyair.com)

- Angular (SSR)
- Nest
- Apollo
- Graphql
- Postgres
- Ionic
- TypeScript

Oransi provides consumer smart air filtration products. This app was built as a hub to connect users' accounts and their air quality settings. It pulls data from various services and serves them in a wonderful UI. The codebase is also used on iOS and Android apps with the help of Ionic.

This was also my first foray into back-end development. Which was an amazing learning opportunity to polish my data management and architectural planning skills.

## MyMedGas ([BeaconMadeas](https://www.beaconmedaes.com))

- React
- Redux
- Material Design
- Highcharts
- Locize
- TypeScript

Beacon was my first project when I started at Big Pixel. It's a legacy React codebase that has been on a long and slow refactoring journey. There are two apps, desktop, and mobile. The former servers as a hub for all the various data points inside the company. Much of which is displayed in tables with vast amounts of data, while still being easily searchable. The mobile app is an entirely different beast. This serves as a tool for on-site engineers doing maintenance and installation requests on medical gas equipment. With the help of Redux, they can log large amounts of technical data offline. An outbox was designed to queue up requests to the API until a stable connection is reached.

All text is managed through Locize for localization and translation across 7 languages.
