My time working independently was a pivotal moment for my career. I primarily worked with statically generate sites built using Hugo and Gatsby. My focus centered around small build sizes and accessible design. This was accomplished by often opting for a custom JavaScript solution, rather than picking a library off the shelf. And techniques such as inlining critical CSS, subsetting fonts, and lazy loading assets did wonders for fast load times and a nice experience on slower connections.

These are some of the sites I helped build:
- **[Decision Point Healthcare](https://decisionpointhealth.com)**
DPH was looking to bring their Figma designs to life with the help of Gatsby. The idea was to make it easier for management and marketing to spin up new pages, write posts, and capture leads. And although Gatsby might seem a bit much for a marketing site, we managed to significantly reduce the bundle but swapping React with Preact.

That, along with small and portable components, and robust integration with Contentful has allowed the team to quickly publish content for their visitors.

- **[YouArePreApproved](https://www.youarepreapproved.com)**
YAPA had a site built over a decade ago that was in dire need of a revamp. But they wanted something that was not just a landing page for potential buyers. We started with Hugo for its speed. But that eventually change into Gatsby. A similar strategy like that of DPH was adopted here, but for a slightly different reason.

Although most of the page was statically generated, the "offers" page required dynamically created tables that were updated every 10 minutes.

The beautiful design you see there was made but a wonderful design firm based in Poland. This was a fantastic collaborative opportunity that exposed me to a new culture and true async communications.
