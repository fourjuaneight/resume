My time working independently was a pivotal moment for my career. I primarily worked with statically generate sites built using Hugo and Gatsby. My focus centered around small build sizes and accessible design. This was accomplished by often opting for a custom JavaScript solution, rather than picking a library off the shelf. And techniques such as inlining critical CSS, subsetting fonts, and lazy loading assets did wonders for fast load times and a nice experience on slower connections.

These are some of the sites I helped build:

## [Decision Point Healthcare](https://decisionpointhealth.com)

- React
- Gatsby
- CSS Modules
- Contentful

DPH was looking to bring their Figma designs to life with the help of Gatsby. The idea was to make it easier for management and marketing to spin up new pages, write posts, and capture leads. Small and reusable components, robust integration with Contentful, and a well-crafted design system have allowed the team to quickly publish content for their visitors and grow their business.

## [YouArePreApproved](https://www.youarepreapproved.com)

- React
- Gatsby
- Redux

YAPA had a site built over a decade ago that was in dire need of a revamp. But they wanted something that was not just a landing page for potential buyers. We landed on Gatsby for its progressive enhancement and ability to scale. The site features several pages with dynamic tables showing lending rates updated at frequent intervals to ensure the latest information.

The beautiful design you see there was made but a wonderful design firm based in Poland. This was a fantastic collaborative opportunity that exposed me to a new culture and true async communications.
