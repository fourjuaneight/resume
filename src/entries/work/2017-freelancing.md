My time working independently was a pivotal moment for my career. I was exposed to a wide range of challenges and unique teams. During this time, I learned to collaborate with small and large teams in a remote setting, while being exposed to a rich diversity in cultures and personalities.

I primarily worked with statically generate sites with Hugo and Gatsby. My focus centered around small build sizes. This was accomplished by often opting for a custom JavaScrit solution, rather than picking a library off the shelf. Techniques such as inlining critical CSS, subsetting fonts, and lazy loading assets did wonders for fast load times and a nice experience on a slower connection.

These are some of the sites I helped build:

- **[YouArePreApproved](https://www.youarepreapproved.com)**

- **[Bonsai](https://bonsai.io)**
