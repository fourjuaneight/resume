My time working independently was a pivotal moment for my career. I primarily worked with statically generate sites built using Hugo and Gatsby. My focus centered around small build sizes and accessible design. This was accomplished by often opting for a custom JavaScript solution, rather than picking a library off the shelf. And techniques such as inlining critical CSS, subsetting fonts, and lazy loading assets did wonders for fast load times and a nice experience on slower connections.

These are some of the sites I helped build:
